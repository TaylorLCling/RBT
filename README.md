Personal Implementation of a Red and Black Self Sorting Binary Tree

Project started years ago with a Red and Black Tree I implemented in College using Java. This code still exists in the current codebase. Recently I wanted to modernize that implementation and translate it into Python. In addition, an ASCII Tree Visualization system was thrown in, using ChatGPT, as a testing tool to add to the legacy helper functions.
